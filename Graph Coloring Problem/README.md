# Exam Scheduling Problem with Graph Coloring
A very typical kind of scheduling problem is the exam scheduling problem.
## Problem
Given all the data about **student course enrollment**
*(A student may enroll into mutiple courses in one semester which causes **overlaping student enrollments**)* 
and **time slot** of the scheduling.
### Goal
the goal is to **minimize the student overlap exam as little as possible** with the **minimum number of timeslots**
</br>*(since if there are overlaping students in two classes and you scheduled the two exam happen at the same time, that will be a terrible situation for those students)*
</br>*(with minimum number of timeslots: since you would want to **fully utilize the resources**)*
